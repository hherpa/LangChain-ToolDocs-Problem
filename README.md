### Description:
The LangChain integration documentation provides basic information about the tools, but gathering complete, up-to-date information requires additional steps. This includes details about subscriptions, regional API availability, and support for different models. I propose enhancing the documentation structure by adding filterable tables with key parameters (e.g., regional availability, cost) to simplify integration for developers.

### Additional Information:
I have prepared a notebook with examples and an analysis of the current documentation structure, along with suggested improvements. I am ready for further discussion and improvement.
